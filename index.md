## About Me


Hi! I'm Haseeb, a student, computer scientist and researcher. I have completed my undergradute in Computer Science from the **Lahore University of Management Sciences** [(LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/programmes/bs-computer-science) where I was advised by [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/). This <strong>Fall</strong> (2023), I will be moving to the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/future-students/programs/computer-science-mmath-waterloo) to begin my Masters of Mathematics (MMath) in Computer Science! 

Besides studying and academic research, I have also worked as a backend software engineer at [Tajir](https://www.tajir.app/sellers), Pakistans first Y-Combinator backed startup! 

Personally, I'm an avid gamer (The civilization series is my favourite) and love to go on hikes! I also enjoy travelling and try my best to make time for it (That's me in Hunza, Gilgit Baltistan!).

## Research Interest

At LUMS, I have primarily worked on <strong>Web Affordability</strong>. I initiated worked on the affordability of advertisement videos on YouTube in developed and developing countries. I tried to answer the question: <strong> If I buy 2GB of mobile data, how much of that is used (wasted) towards ad videos? </strong> Besides this, I have also worked on developing techniques to capture page size reductions on various mobile apps such as Opera and Brave. This helped us with analysis in our recently published work (SIGCOMM 2023).
